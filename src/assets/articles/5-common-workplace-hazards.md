## Introduction

Workplace hazards exist in every industry, from construction sites to corporate offices. While the specific risks vary by sector, certain hazards appear consistently across Australian workplaces. Understanding these common hazards and implementing effective controls is fundamental to creating a safe working environment and meeting WHS obligations.

This article identifies the five most prevalent workplace hazards and provides practical, proven control measures that can be implemented immediately.

## Understanding the Hierarchy of Controls

Before diving into specific hazards, it's essential to understand the hierarchy of controls—the internationally recognized system for minimizing or eliminating exposure to hazards:

1. **Elimination:** Physically remove the hazard
2. **Substitution:** Replace the hazard with something less dangerous
3. **Engineering Controls:** Isolate people from the hazard
4. **Administrative Controls:** Change the way people work
5. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Protect the worker with equipment

The most effective controls are at the top of the hierarchy. Always consider higher-order controls before relying on PPE.

## Hazard 1: Slips, Trips, and Falls

### The Risk

Slips, trips, and falls represent the most common workplace accidents in Australia, accounting for approximately 30% of serious workplace injuries. They occur across all industries and can result in serious injuries including fractures, head trauma, and spinal damage.

### Common Causes

- Wet or contaminated floors
- Uneven surfaces and damaged flooring
- Obstructed walkways
- Poor lighting
- Inappropriate footwear
- Working at heights without proper protection
- Unsecured cables and equipment

### Effective Controls

**Elimination and Substitution:**
- Remove unnecessary elevation changes

- Provide edge protection and guardrails for elevated work areas
- Use scaffolding or elevated work platforms instead of ladders where feasible

**Administrative Controls:**
- Establish housekeeping procedures and schedules
- Implement immediate spill response protocols
- Create designated walkways and keep them clear
- Regular inspection and maintenance programs
- Signage for wet floors and hazardous areas

**PPE:**
- Appropriate footwear with slip-resistant soles
- Safety harnesses for work at heights

## Hazard 2: Manual Handling Injuries

### The Risk

Manual handling—lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, or moving objects—causes approximately 25% of workplace injuries in Australia. These injuries primarily affect the back, shoulders, and neck, often resulting in chronic conditions that impact workers long-term.

### Common Causes

- Lifting heavy or awkward loads
- Repetitive movements
- Sustained awkward postures
- Forceful exertions
- Inadequate rest breaks
- Poor technique

### Effective Controls

**Elimination and Substitution:**
- Automate material handling processes
- Reduce load weights through smaller packaging
- Eliminate unnecessary manual handling tasks

**Engineering Controls:**
- Implement mechanical aids (trolleys, hoists, conveyors, forklifts)
- Install height-adjustable work surfaces
- Use gravity-fed systems where possible
- Design workstations to minimize reaching, bending, and twisting
- Provide lifting aids and equipment

**Administrative Controls:**
- Conduct manual handling risk assessments
- Provide comprehensive manual handling training
- Implement job rotation to reduce repetitive strain
- Ensure adequate rest breaks
- Use team lifting for heavy items
- Create clear manual handling procedures

**PPE:**
- Back support belts (as supplementary control only, not primary protection)
- Appropriate gloves for grip

## Hazard 3: Hazardous Substances

### The Risk

Exposure to hazardous chemicals causes thousands of workplace illnesses and injuries annually. Effects range from acute poisoning and burns to long-term conditions including respiratory diseases, dermatitis, and cancer.

### Common Hazardous Substances

- Cleaning chemicals
- Solvents and degreasers
- Paints and coatings
- Fuels and oils
- Adhesives
- Dust (silica, wood, metal)
- Biological agents

### Effective Controls

**Elimination and Substitution:**
- Remove hazardous substances from the workplace entirely
- Replace with less hazardous alternatives (e.g., water-based instead of solvent-based products)
- Use safer application methods (paste instead of spray)

**Engineering Controls:**
- Install local exhaust ventilation
- Implement enclosed systems for hazardous processes
- Use fume cupboards and ventilation hoods
- Provide emergency eyewash stations and safety showers
- Implement containment systems

**Administrative Controls:**
- Maintain Safety Data Sheets (SDS) register
- Conduct exposure monitoring
- Establish safe work procedures
- Provide comprehensive training on chemical handling
- Implement chemical storage and labeling systems
- Conduct health monitoring for exposed workers
- Minimize the number of people exposed

**PPE:**
- Respirators (appropriate for the specific hazard)
- Chemical-resistant gloves
- Eye and face protection
- Protective clothing
- Appropriate footwear

## Hazard 4: Noise Exposure

### The Risk

Prolonged exposure to excessive noise causes permanent hearing loss—a condition affecting thousands of Australian workers. Once hearing is damaged, it cannot be restored. Beyond hearing loss, excessive noise contributes to stress, fatigue, and communication difficulties that can increase other safety risks.

### Common Sources

- Machinery and equipment
- Power tools
- Vehicles and mobile plant
- Manufacturing processes
- Construction activities
- Compressed air equipment

### Effective Controls

**Elimination and Substitution:**
- Remove noisy processes from the workplace
- Replace noisy equipment with quieter alternatives
- Use alternative quieter work methods

**Engineering Controls:**
- Install acoustic enclosures around noisy machinery
- Use vibration damping and isolation mounts
- Implement sound-absorbing materials (acoustic panels, curtains)
- Maintain equipment to reduce noise from wear
- Separate noisy operations from other work areas
- Use noise barriers and screens

**Administrative Controls:**
- Conduct noise assessments and mapping
- Implement exposure monitoring programs
- Limit time workers spend in high-noise areas
- Provide hearing testing for exposed workers
- Create quiet zones for breaks
- Schedule noisy work when fewer people are present
- Establish noise management procedures

**PPE:**
- Appropriate hearing protection (earplugs or earmuffs)
- Regular fit testing for hearing protection
- Training on correct use and maintenance

## Hazard 5: Psychosocial Hazards

### The Risk

Psychosocial hazards—factors in work design, management, and environment that cause psychological or physical harm—are increasingly recognized as significant workplace risks. They contribute to stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout, and can increase the risk of physical injuries through reduced concentration and fatigue.

### Common Psychosocial Hazards

- High job demands and workload
- Low job control and autonomy
- Poor support from management or colleagues
- Unclear roles and responsibilities
- Job insecurity
- Workplace bullying or harassment
- Violence or aggression
- Inadequate recognition and reward
- Poor work-life balance

### Effective Controls

**Elimination and Substitution:**
- Remove or redesign work that creates unreasonable demands
- Eliminate unnecessary stressors from work processes

**Engineering Controls:**
- Design workspaces that support privacy and concentration
- Provide quiet areas and break rooms
- Implement technology to reduce repetitive or stressful tasks

**Administrative Controls:**
- Conduct psychosocial risk assessments
- Implement workload management systems
- Provide clear role descriptions and expectations
- Ensure adequate staffing levels
- Offer flexible work arrangements
- Establish anti-bullying and harassment policies
- Create clear communication channels
- Implement conflict resolution procedures
- Provide Employee Assistance Programs (EAP)
- Train managers in supportive leadership
- Foster respectful workplace culture
- Regular check-ins and performance discussions
- Recognition and reward programs

**Support Systems:**
- Access to mental health professionals
- Peer support programs
- Stress management training
- Resilience building programs

## Implementing Effective Risk Control

### Risk Assessment Process

For each identified hazard:

1. **Identify the hazard**
2. **Assess the risk** (likelihood × consequence)
3. **Implement controls** (following the hierarchy)
4. **Review effectiveness** regularly
5. **Update controls** as needed

### Documentation

Maintain records of:
- Risk assessments
- Control measures implemented
- Training provided
- Inspections and maintenance
- Incident investigations
- Review and improvement activities

### Worker Consultation

Effective hazard control requires worker involvement:
- Workers often have the best understanding of practical hazards
- Consultation improves control effectiveness
- Involvement increases buy-in and compliance
- Legal requirement under WHS legislation

## Conclusion

While workplace hazards vary across industries, these five hazards represent significant risks in virtually every Australian workplace. The good news is that effective controls exist for each, and many can be implemented without significant cost.

The key to successful hazard management is systematic identification, assessment, and control implementation following the hierarchy of controls. Rather than relying solely on PPE and administrative measures, focus on eliminating or engineering out hazards wherever possible.

Remember that hazard management is not a one-time activity. Regular review, worker consultation, and continuous improvement ensure your controls remain effective as work processes and conditions change.
