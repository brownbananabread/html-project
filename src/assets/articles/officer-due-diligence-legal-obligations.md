## Introduction

If you're a company director, partner, board member, or hold an executive position with decision-making authority, you're likely an "officer" under Australian WHS law—and you have specific legal obligations that cannot be delegated.

Unlike general workplace safety duties that can be assigned to safety managers or supervisors, officer due diligence is a personal responsibility. Failure to meet these obligations can result in significant personal penalties, including fines up to $600,000 and imprisonment.

This article clarifies what officer due diligence means, what's required to demonstrate it, and how to ensure you're meeting your legal obligations.

## Who is an Officer?

Under the Work Health and Safety Act, an "officer" is defined based on role and influence, not job title. You're likely an officer if you:

- Are a company director
- Make or participate in decisions affecting the whole or substantial part of the business
- Have the capacity to significantly affect the financial standing of the business
- Give instructions or directions that directors are accustomed to following

**Key Point:** You don't have to have "officer" in your job title. Chief executives, chief financial officers, chief operating officers, and other senior executives are typically officers under WHS law.

## What is Due Diligence?

Due diligence means taking reasonable steps to ensure your organization complies with its WHS duties. It's not about doing everything personally—it's about ensuring the organization has appropriate systems in place and that they're working effectively.

Due diligence is:
- **Proactive** (not reactive)
- **Ongoing** (not one-time)
- **Verifiable** (you must be able to demonstrate it)
- **Personal** (you can't delegate the responsibility)

## The Six Elements of Due Diligence

The WHS Act specifies six key areas where officers must exercise due diligence:

### 1. Acquire and Maintain Knowledge of WHS Matters

**The Requirement:**
Officers must have sufficient understanding of WHS matters relevant to their business, including:
- Nature of operations and associated hazards
- WHS risks arising from those operations
- Methods to eliminate or minimize those risks

**What This Means in Practice:**
- Undertake WHS training appropriate for your role
- Stay current with WHS developments in your industry
- Understand the specific hazards your workers face
- Know the major WHS risks your organization manages
- Maintain awareness of WHS regulatory changes

**Evidence of Compliance:**
- Completion of officer-level WHS training
- Attendance at WHS briefings and updates
- Board papers and minutes showing WHS consideration
- Industry association participation
- Documented learning from incidents or near-misses

**Common Gaps:**
- Assuming WHS knowledge from decades ago remains current
- Believing WHS is someone else's responsibility
- Failing to understand specific hazards in your operations
- Not keeping up with regulatory changes

### 2. Gain Understanding of Operations and Associated Hazards

**The Requirement:**
Officers must understand the nature of operations and the hazards and risks associated with those operations.

**What This Means in Practice:**
- Conduct regular workplace visits
- Observe actual work being performed
- Speak with workers about their tasks and concerns
- Review significant risks identified in risk assessments
- Understand critical controls protecting workers
- Know what could go seriously wrong

**Evidence of Compliance:**
- Records of workplace visits and observations
- Photos or documentation from site inspections
- Meeting notes from discussions with operational managers
- Briefings on new operations or significant changes
- Understanding of major incident scenarios

**Common Gaps:**
- Never or rarely visiting workplaces
- Confining visits to controlled circumstances only
- Not engaging with workers directly
- Relying solely on filtered information from managers

### 3. Ensure Appropriate Resources and Processes

**The Requirement:**
Officers must ensure the organization has and uses appropriate resources and processes to eliminate or minimize WHS risks.

**What This Means in Practice:**

**Resources:**
- Adequate budget for WHS activities

- Communication of safety information (toolbox talks, bulletins)
- Verification of training effectiveness

**Common Gaps:**
- Inadequate induction processes
- Training focused on compliance over competency
- Insufficient supervision of high-risk work
- Failing to verify workers understand and apply training

### 5. Ensure Processes for Receiving and Considering Information

**The Requirement:**
Officers must ensure processes exist for receiving and considering information about incidents, hazards, and risks, and for responding in a timely way.

**What This Means in Practice:**

**Information Flow:**
- Incident reports reach appropriate decision-makers
- Worker concerns and hazard reports are escalated
- Emerging risks are brought to officer attention

**Common Gaps:**
- No formal reporting to board/executive level
- Information filtered or sanitized before reaching officers
- Delayed responses to serious issues
- Lack of follow-up on recommendations

### 6. Ensure Compliance Verification and Continuous Improvement

**The Requirement:**
Officers must ensure processes exist for complying with duties and reviewing, monitoring, and improving performance.

**What This Means in Practice:**

**Compliance Verification:**
- Regular audits of WHS management systems
- Inspections to verify controls are implemented
- Checking that policies and procedures are followed
- Monitoring compliance with legal requirements

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Leading indicators (inspections, training, near-misses reported)
- Lagging indicators (injuries, incidents, lost time)
- Trend analysis and benchmarking
- Regular performance reporting

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Acting on audit and inspection findings
- Learning from incidents and near-misses
- Updating systems based on new knowledge
- Setting and tracking improvement objectives

**Evidence of Compliance:**
- Audit programs and results
- Performance dashboards and reports
- Evidence of system improvements
- Action plans for addressing deficiencies
- Board/executive review of WHS performance

**Common Gaps:**
- Audits that verify paperwork, not actual practice
- Performance reporting focused only on lagging indicators
- No follow-up on audit recommendations
- Failing to learn from incidents

## How to Demonstrate Due Diligence

### Create a Personal Due Diligence Plan

Document your approach to meeting each element:

**Knowledge Acquisition:**
- Scheduled WHS training and updates
- Regular industry briefings
- Subscription to relevant updates

**Understanding Operations:**
- Quarterly workplace visits
- Annual hazard reviews
- Meetings with safety personnel

**Resource Allocation:**
- Annual WHS budget review
- Periodic staffing assessment
- Investment in safety technology

**Training and Supervision:**
- Review of training programs and completion rates
- Verification of supervision adequacy

**Information Flow:**
- Monthly WHS reports to board/executive
- Immediate notification protocols for serious incidents

**Verification:**
- Annual audit program
- Quarterly performance reviews
- Regular management system reviews

### Maintain Due Diligence Evidence

Keep records that demonstrate your actions:

- **Meeting attendance:** Board/executive meetings where WHS discussed
- **Training certificates:** Your own WHS training completion
- **Site visit records:** Photos, notes, observations from workplace visits
- **Correspondence:** Emails and memos addressing WHS matters
- **Decisions:** Records of WHS-related approvals and resource allocations
- **Reviews:** Notes from reviewing reports, audits, and incident investigations

### Regular Officer-Level Reviews

Schedule regular reviews (typically quarterly) covering:

- WHS performance against objectives
- Significant incidents and investigation outcomes
- Audit and inspection findings
- Compliance status
- Resource adequacy
- Emerging risks
- Improvement initiatives

## What Happens When Officers Fail Due Diligence?

### Legal Consequences

Officers who fail to exercise due diligence can face:

- **Category 2 offenses:** Up to $600,000 in fines
- **Category 3 offenses:** Up to $300,000 in fines
- **Imprisonment:** In cases involving reckless conduct

**Important:** These are personal penalties, not covered by the company or insurance.

### When are Officers Prosecuted?

Prosecution is more likely when:

- Serious incidents occur (fatalities, permanent disabilities)
- Systemic failures are evident
- Officers were aware of risks but failed to act
- Previous incidents or warnings were ignored
- Resources or support were deliberately withheld

### Recent Case Examples

While specific cases vary, prosecutions have occurred where:

- Officers received incident reports but took no action
- Budget constraints prevented implementation of known controls
- Officers failed to ensure critical safety systems were implemented
- Expertise was not engaged for complex hazards despite knowledge gaps

## Common Questions

### Can I Delegate Due Diligence?

**No.** While you can delegate WHS tasks and functions to managers and safety professionals, you cannot delegate your duty to exercise due diligence. You remain personally responsible for ensuring appropriate systems exist and work effectively.

### What if I'm Not a Safety Expert?

You're not expected to be a safety professional, but you are expected to:
- Ensure the organization employs appropriate expertise
- Ask questions about significant risks
- Verify that expert advice is being followed
- Escalate when responses seem inadequate

### How Much Time Should Due Diligence Take?

This varies by organization size and risk profile, but expect:
- Regular board/executive agenda time for WHS (every meeting)
- Quarterly detailed reviews (several hours)
- Annual workplace visits (multiple days for multi-site operations)
- Ongoing learning and briefings (several hours quarterly)

### What About Small Businesses?

The same legal requirements apply, though practical implementation differs. In small businesses, officers typically have closer involvement in operations, which can make verification easier, but the same six elements must be addressed.

## Implementing Effective Due Diligence

### Step 1: Assess Current State

- What are you currently doing for each of the six elements?
- What evidence exists of your due diligence?
- What gaps exist?

### Step 2: Develop Your Due Diligence Plan

- Schedule regular activities for each element
- Assign time for WHS consideration
- Create documentation practices

### Step 3: Ensure Information Flows to You

- Establish reporting structures
- Set expectations for escalation
- Create scheduled briefing cycles

### Step 4: Verify Systems Work in Practice

- Visit workplaces personally
- Speak with workers directly
- Review actual implementation, not just documentation

### Step 5: Document Your Actions

- Keep records of what you do
- Document decisions and rationale
- Maintain evidence of follow-up

### Step 6: Continuously Improve

- Learn from incidents
- Act on audit findings
- Update your approach based on experience

## Conclusion

Officer due diligence is a serious personal responsibility under Australian WHS law. While it requires genuine commitment of time and attention, it's fundamentally about ensuring your organization has appropriate systems to protect workers and that those systems are actually working.

The key is being proactive: don't wait for an incident to verify your WHS systems are effective. Regular, systematic attention to the six elements of due diligence protects both your workers and yourself.

Remember, due diligence isn't about being perfect—it's about taking reasonable steps to ensure your organization meets its WHS obligations. Document what you do, ask the hard questions, and act when gaps are identified. That's what reasonable due diligence looks like.
